# Mental Health Self-Assessment App ðŸ§ 

## Project overview :
This project implements a logistic regression model to predict whether a student is in good or not good mental health based on responses to an HTML form.

## Features:

â€¢	User-friendly web interface built with Flask.

â€¢	Inputs : stress, sleep, concentration, enery and motivation.

â€¢	AI model : logistic regression to predict mental health.

â€¢	Personalized advice based on user responses.


## Technologies :
Python
Flask
Scikit-learn
Pandas
HTML/CSS for fronted
Joblib
SQLite

## What I learned :

â€¢	Generation, engineering and analyzing data with Pandas and Numpy.

â€¢	Training and evaluating logistic regression models with scikit-learn.

â€¢	Creating an API with Flask and user-friendly web interface with HTML and CSS.

## Challenges and solutions :

To make the training realistic and challenging for the AI model, I added noise to responses to simulate natural variations in human answers and injected 10% full random answers to simulate inconsistent or noisy data during data generation.

I also had to align input form data with the model's expected features, like inverting stress scores. solved by preprocessing user inputs before prediction.

Created a responsive and clean design with a green theme for comfort and accessibility.
